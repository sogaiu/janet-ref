# special form

# `(quasiquote x)`

# Similar to `(quote x)`, but allows for unquoting within `x`.

# This makes `quasiquote` useful for writing macros, as a macro
# definition often generates a lot of templated code with a few custom
# values.

# The shorthand for `quasiquote` is a leading tilde `~` before a form.
# So `(quasiquote x)` is equivalent to `~x`.

# With that form, `(unquote x)` will evaluate and insert `x` into the
# `unquote` form.

# For further info, see:
