# special form

# `(if condition when-true when-false?)`

# Introduce a branching construct.

# The first form is the condition, the second form is the form to
# evaluate when the condition is `true`, and the optional third form
# is the form to evaluate when the condition is `false`. If no third
# form is provided it defaults to `nil`.

# The `if` special form will not evaluate the `when-true` or
# `when-false` forms unless it needs to - it is a lazy form, which is
# why it cannot be a function.

# The condition is considered `false` only if it evaluates to `nil` or
# `false` - all other values are considered `true`.

# For further info, see:
