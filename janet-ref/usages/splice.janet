# special form

# `(splice x)`

# The `splice` special form is an interesting form that allows an
# array or tuple to be put into another form inline.

# It only has an effect in two places - as an argument in a function
# call or literal constructor, or as the argument to the unquote
# form.

# Outside of these two settings, the `splice` special form simply
# evaluates directly to its argument x.

# The shorthand for splice is prefixing a form with a semicolon.  So
# `(splice form)` is equivalent to `;form`.

# The splice special form has no effect on the behavior of other
# special forms, except as an argument to unquote.

# In the context of a function call, `splice` will insert the contents
# of `x` in the parameter list.
