# special form

# `(quote x)`

# Evaluates to the literal value of the first argument.

# The argument is not compiled and is simply used as a constant value
# in the compiled code.

# Preceding a form with a single quote is shorthand for `(quote
# form)`.  Thus `'form` and `(quote form)` are equivalent.
